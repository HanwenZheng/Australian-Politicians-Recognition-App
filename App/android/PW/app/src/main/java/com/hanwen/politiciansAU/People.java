It is led by Cory Bernardi, who had been elected to the Senate for the Liberal Party, but resigned citing disagreements with the Liberal/National Coalition, its policies and leadership under Malcolm Turnbull.\n" +
                "The Family First Party and its two state parliamentarians, Dennis Hood and Robert Brokenshire, joined and merged with the Australian Conservatives in April 2017. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the 2018 state election; Hood left the Conservatives to join the Liberal Party on 26 March 2018, leaving Bernardi as the sole remaining member in federal parliament, whose present term in the senate runs until 30 June 2022.\n" +

During his time in Parliament, Bernardi has attracted controversy over several statements and views. On 7 February 2017, Bernardi announced that he would be leaving the Liberal Party to form his own partyâthe Australian Conservatives.\n");
