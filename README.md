# Australian Politicians Recognition App
## A University of Melbourne project
In this project, we use thousands of images of Australian politicians to train a face recognition network over pretrained Alexnet / MobileNet models.

## File Structure
- [Alexnet](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/Alexnet "Alexnet"): codes to retrain AlexNet and test retrained model
- [App](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/App "App"): codes of Politicians_AU Recognition App
- [Dataset](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/Dataset "Dataset"): link to our online training Dataset
- [Image_Preprocessing](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/Image_Preprocessing "Image_Preprocessing"): codes to pre-process Dataset
- [Mobilenet](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/Mobilenet "Mobilenet"): codes to retrain MobileNet
- [Trained_Models](https://github.com/HanwenZheng/PoliticiansAU_Recognition/tree/master/Trained_Models "Trained_Models"): final version of trained AlexNet / MobileNet model
