# Australian Politicians Recognition App
## Working Environment
Codes in this project assumes you are using the following environment:
- Python 3.7.3
- Anaconda 3
## A University of Melbourne project
In this project, we use thousands of images of Australian politicians to train a face recognition network over pretrained Alexnet / MobileNet models.
